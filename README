Here is the repository for committing changes to source files for the gPC BPVE research project.

Some notes:
- Legacy files (read: not handled using new version control system) are included, however they
are left untouched. In order to work on a legacy file, it is recommended to copy the latest version
to the master folder and handle it with git versioning (i.e. remove ***vx* tag for primitive versions)
