\maketitle

This project took place primarily over spring term, 2012. Currently, the timeline is as follows:
\begin{table}[H]
\begin{tabularx}{\linewidth}{c X}\toprule
Week	&	Activities \\\midrule
1,2		&	Background research on articular cartilage,
			BVPE model, partial differential equations
			and other related topics, with an emphasis
			on previous wo7nomial chaos from an analytical perspective,
			sketched out mechanics for application to a computer
			model\\
5,6		&	Implemented the BVPE model of articular cartilage
			in MATLAB using an advection/diffusion model\\
7,8		&	Improved MATLAB model (using the Crank-Nicolson theta method) and
			implemented polynomial chaos into the mathematical model \\
9,10	&	(Projected) Polynomial chaos method compared for accuracy,
			efficiency to existing numerical solution methods. Final draft
			of project documents created. Project presented at CUE, submitted
			to ScholarArchive. \\\bottomrule
\end{tabularx}
\end{table}

Note that as this project has not been officially presented in public (CUE is not until next week), final loose ends are still being tied up. Current intention is present
at the Celebrating Undergraduate Excellence event on May 31, 2012 in the Memorial
Union Ballroom. Presentation format is like to be a poster, other events are likely as
well.
